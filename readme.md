Three Rmarkdown files that can be executed in R. This files contains sections of the narrative found in the published paper and R code used to analyse the data, compute statistics, and generate the figures. To execute these files, ensure all the files are together in a directory in the same structure as they are in this repository, then open R and run `knitr::knit2html("XXX")` where XXX is the name of the Rmd, including the .Rmd suffix and the quotation marks. There are many dependencies on non-core R packages and other software, see the dependencies section below for more details.
 
Three R files containing code that the Rmarkdown file uses to load libraries, prepare radiocarbon dates for OxCal calibration, and manage dependencies.  

Five csv files of data. Three of these are raw data on age determinations, stone artefacts and shells. Two are input and output from the [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) radiocarbon date calibration service. 

Two Rdata files that contain output from Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. These take more than a few minutes to run so for convenience the outputs are bundled in here and loaded by the Rmarkdown files. The code for running the simulations is also included in the Rmarkdown files.

Three html files that contain output produced by the code in the Rmarkdown files. These are what you should get if the Rmarkdown files execute properly. 

Six svg files and four png files that are the figures generated by the code in the Rmarkdown files. Two of the svg files have been edited slightly for clarity, both the original and edited versions are included.
